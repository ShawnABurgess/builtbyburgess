							<p>I have been in and around the construction industry my entire life. At a young age, it was not uncommon to find my brothers and I on a jobsite, tagging along with our father, an electrician, when he got stuck with babysitting duty. Those times spent gathering wood scraps and loose nails to hobble together things that resembled a car, a house, or maybe a jump for our bicycles, was the start of a passion that would in turn become a career. </p>
							<p>Working for a local custom home builder throughout high school, and during college as I earned a bachelor's degree in Construction Technology, taught me invaluable lessons about the industry as well as most importantly, a strong work ethic. Most the while, in addition to a full work and school schedule, I would make time to do projects on the side for a growing customer base. The skills and knowledge I gained led me to managerial experiences redeveloping high rise buildings in Boston as well as doing large commercial building energy efficiency retrofits. </p>
							<p>All of my experiences and desire to do better were geared towards one goal, of building a home building company focused on providing the best product possible for its clients, with the same attention to detail that I would expect on my own home. And that is what drives me, every day. </p>

                                    <p>Most people look at their home as their largest asset. However, the reality is, it's probably their largest liability. They can weigh a heavy burden on the owner with seemingly endless maintenance, heating and cooling cost, electricity cost, in addition to a mortgage, insurance, and taxes. This is a burden less and less people are willing to accept, despite the availability of products and knowledge that can reduce if not eliminate much of that burden. </p>

Focused on providing our clients with comfortable, healthy, safe places to live and enjoy their family. Homes that work for you, and not the other way around.

                    <h4>Boylston, MA</h4>
                    <p>We have nothing but praise for Jason Burgess and Burgess Homes. Jason was referred to us by a neighbor when we announced we were ready to upgrade our kitchen. He installed our tile, located and installed new cabinet hinges and added soft-close drawer slides. He added new cabinets to increase our storage space. Not only is Jason a skilled builder, but an invaluable, creative resource. After we had our granite counters installed, we were trying to come up with the perfect kitchen table. Our kitchen is too small for an island, so Jason suggested building a counter that would serve as a table and work space. He designed and built the base for the added granite counter...everything to perfect specifications (to the amazement of our granite vendor!) When it was time to purchase appliances, Jason steered us to a store that saved us a boat load. He recommended changing all our outlets to match our newly painted cabinets. We never would have thought of that. He stayed focused on our project and ultimately, he completed the project on time and on budget. We love our kitchen!</p>

                    <p>Jason Burgess of Burgess Homes did an exceptional job finishing our Bonus Room above the garage. The attention to detail throughout the project was second to none. The communication    and project updates using the Client Access on the website was easy and informative. From the initial plans, the materials used, construction and the finished product we couldn’t be happier. We had several smaller projects around the house and there was no question that Burgess Homes would get the job done. The Bonus Room was a stress free project that I know was  done right!!</p>
